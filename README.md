I am a Master’s graduate in Computer Science from [Cleveland State University](https://www.csuohio.edu/) in Ohio, having completed my studies in May 2023. My educational journey has honed my skills in Full Stack Development, primarily working with JavaScript, Node.js, React, and cloud platforms like AWS, and Azure.

My passion lies in creating sleek and efficient web applications, and my projects reflect my coding and creative prowess. I love exploring new tech stack and building projects that solve real-world problems.
